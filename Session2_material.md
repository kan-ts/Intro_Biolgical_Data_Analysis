## The data

The data would resolved around [Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. LT2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/152?genome_assembly_id=305903)
please download the genome sequence in FASTA format, protein sequence, and genome annotation in gff and tabular format.

In addition, download the [Cas3 protein sequences](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NP_461865.1), using build-in search function in genome annotation.
